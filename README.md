iDreamBooks Single Page App

A Single Page Application built entirely using jQuery. No other MVC frameworks used.

Fixed Views
The Navigation Bar and Genres List are fixed for all views. These do not change

Routing and Views
There are 3 main pages/views that change. The 'Books List', Book Detial', and 'Shows List'. The URL is also updated on each new view, so that the views can be reaccessed via the URL.

Plugins Used - 
jQuery - do more, write less JavaScript
Handlbars.js - templating engine to allow looping and conditional statements in HTML markup
Bar Rating JS - allows Star Rating bars to be displayed with rating based on input values. Used to show the rating for the critics reviews.
